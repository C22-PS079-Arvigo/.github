## Description

During the purchasing decision process in e-commerce, it is difficult for customers to try and determine which fashion and makeup products are most suitable for them, so there is a possibility of customer dissatisfaction due to getting products that do not match the customer's wishes after purchase. This greatly affects the quality of service for SMEs.

To overcome these problems, our team will develop the Arvigo application with Augmented Reality integration so that users can try fashion and makeup products in virtual three dimensions and find out the best product recommendations based on the user's face shape and personality using machine learning. In addition, consumers can also get recommendations for the best deals from online and offline stores across Indonesia.
